Revision history for Template-Plugin-TwoStage

0.06      2010-08-09 10:43:50 Europe/Berlin
 - set DEBUG constant via environment variable
 - debugging; support for extend_keys callback
   method got mangled when introducing plugin 
   configuration via TT configuration hash
 - moved repository to git and let Dist::Zilla
   plugin bundle @Git and plugin BumpVersionFromGit
   do the version bumping for us

0.05       2010-07-05
* dzil'ed the distribution
* reorganization and expansion of documentation
* introduced plugin configuration via TT configuration 
  hash
* satisfied Perl::Critic a bit more

0.04       2010-06-08
* unicode support - decoded/encoded templates stay 
  decoded/encoded in their precompiled version
* the plugin now owns a specific provider object for
  the retrieval of precompiled versions of templates -
  this should make it compatible with any type
  of provider class used in the TT object
* based sample code on an imaginary Catalyst application
* cleaned up docs a bit
* refactoring test definitions for Template::Test : 
  made use of -- name: xx -- mark up for labeling 
  test cases

0.03       2010-06-06
* precompiled versions are stored in binary mode now
  bypassing any io layers, and making tests pass also on
  win platforms (CRLF io layer issues)
* added missing LICENSE command to Makefile.PL
* consideration of undefined values when storing  
  precompilation keys together with precompiled 
  templates
* fixing minor typos in docs

0.02       2009-04-02
* extended and clarified documentation
* prefer to rethrow template exceptions 
* don't let TT stash variable 'TwoStage.precompile_mode'
  - used to indicate precompilation stage in the stash -
  interfere with default variable name for plugin object
  'TwoStage' when instantiating the TwoStage plugin 
  without assigning it to a variable at the same time
  ("USE TwoStage;" vs. "USE cache = TwoStage;");
  moved to variable name 'TwoStage_precompile_mode'
* give 1st stage caching files the file extension '.tt'

0.01       2008-10-01
bumped up version to first non-developer release

0.01_02    2008-09-25 - developer release
* added dependency on constant.pm
* made constants declarations compatible with version 
  1.02 of constants.pm included in perl version 5.62
  ( we were moving away from declaration of multiple 
  constants in a single statement )
