0.02       2009-04-02
* extended and clarified documentation
* prefer to rethrow template exceptions 
* don't let TT stash variable 'TwoStage.precompile_mode'
  - used to indicate precompilation stage in the stash -
  interfere with default variable name for plugin object
  'TwoStage' when instantiating the TwoStage plugin 
  without assigning it to a variable at the same type
  ("USE TwoStage;" vs. "USE cache = TwoStage;");
  moved to variable name 'TwoStage_precompile_mode'
* give 1st stage caching files the file extension '.tt'
